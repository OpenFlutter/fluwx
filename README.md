## Capability

- Share images, texts, music and so on to WeChat, including session, favorite and timeline.
- Payment with WeChat.
- Get auth code before you login in with WeChat.
- Launch mini program in WeChat.
- Subscribe Message.
- Just open WeChat app.
- Launch app From wechat link.

## Preparation

[Migrate to V4 now](./doc/MIGRATE_TO_V4_CN.md)

> Breaking changes ：*Fluwx* won't request permission(WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE) since 4.5.0. That means you will need to handle permission when sharing images, if FileProvider is not supported.

`Fluwx` is good but not God. You'd better read [official documents](https://developers.weixin.qq.com/doc/oplatform/Mobile_App/Resource_Center_Homepage.html) before
integrating `Fluwx`. Then you'll understand how to generate Android signature, what's universal link for iOS, how to add URL schema for iOS and so on.

## Install

Add the following dependencies in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

`Fluwx` with pay:

```yaml
dependencies:
  fluwx: ^${latestVersion}
```

![pub package](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/fluwx.svg)

> [!NOTE]
> `fluwx` without pay:<br/>
> Developers who need to exclude payment for iOS can set `no_pay: true` in pubspec.yaml.<br/>
> See the example: [example/pubspec.yaml](./example/pubspec.yaml#L19)<br/>

> [!WARNING]
> Never forget to replace ^${latestVersion} with an actual version!

## Configurations

`Fluwx` enables multiple configurations in the section `fluwx` of `pubspec.yaml` from v4, you can reference [pubspec.yaml](./example/pubspec.yaml#L10)
for more details.

> For iOS, some configurations, such as url_scheme，universal_link, LSApplicationQueriesSchemes, can be configured by `fluwx`,
> what you need to do is to fill configurations in `pubspec.yaml`

- app_id. Recommend. It'll be used to generate scheme on iOS。This is not used to init WeChat SDK so you still need to call `fluwx.registerApi` manually.
- debug_logging. Optional. Enable logs by setting it `true`.
- flutter_activity. Optional. This is usually used by cold boot from WeChat on Android. `Fluwx` will try to launch launcher activity if not set.
- universal_link. Recommend for iOS. It'll be used to generate universal link on your projects.
- scene_delegate. Optional. Use `AppDelegate` or `SceneDelegate`. See [official documents](https://developers.weixin.qq.com/doc/oplatform/Mobile_App/Access_Guide/iOS.html) for more details.

- For iOS
 If you are failing `cannot load such file -- plist` on iOS, please do the following steps:

```shell
# step.1 install missing dependencies
sudo gem install plist
# step.2 enter iOS folder(example/ios/,ios/)
cd example/ios/
# step.3 execute
pod install
```

- On OpenHarmony, to check if WeChat is installed, add the following to the module.json5 in your project

```json5
{
  "module": {
    "querySchemes": [
      "weixin"
    ],
  }
}
```

## Register WxAPI

Register your app via `fluwx` if necessary.

```dart
Fluwx fluwx = Fluwx();
fluwx.registerApi(appId: "wxd930ea5d5a228f5f",universalLink: "https://your.univerallink.com/link/");
```

The param `universalLink` only works with iOS. You can read [this document](https://developers.weixin.qq.com/doc/oplatform/Mobile_App/Access_Guide/iOS.html) to learn
how to create universalLink. You can also learn how to add URL schema, how to add `LSApplicationQueriesSchemes` in your iOS project. This is essential.

For Android, you shall know to how generate signature for your app in [this page](https://developers.weixin.qq.com/doc/oplatform/Downloads/Android_Resource.html).
And you have to understand the difference between debug signature and release signature. Once the signature is incorrect, then you'll get `errCode = -1`.

It' better to register your API as early as possible.

## Capability Document

- [Basic knowledge](./doc/BASIC_KNOWLEDGE.md)
- [Share](./doc/SHARE.md)
- [Payment](./doc/PAYMENT.md)
- [Auth](./doc/AUTH.md)
- [Launch app from h5](./doc/LAUNCH_APP_FROM_H5.md)
